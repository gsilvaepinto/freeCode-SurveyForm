# freeCodeCamp Survey Form

<p>This project is part of the Responsive Web Design course by <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">freecodecamp.org</a>. I tried to make the survey form as responsive as possible <i>(not mandatory int the project)</i>, but there are still some things to improve.</p>
